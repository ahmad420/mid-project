                  <p>World War II was the deadliest military conflict in history. <br>
                 An estimated total of 70–85 million people perished, or about 3% of the 1940 world population (est. 2.3 billion).[1] Deaths directly caused by the war (including military and civilian fatalities) are estimated at 50–56 million,<br> with an additional estimated 19–28 million deaths from war-related disease and famine. Civilian deaths totaled 50–55 million. Military deaths from all causes totaled 21–25 million, including deaths in captivity of about 5 million prisoners of war. <br> More than half of the total number of casualties are accounted for by the dead of the Republic of China and of the Soviet Union. The tables below give a detailed country-by-country count of human losses. Statistics on the number of military wounded are included whenever available. <br>

                Recent historical scholarship has shed new light on the topic of Second World War casualties. <br> Research in Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union has caused a revision of estimates of Soviet World War II fatalities.[2] According to Russian government figures, <br> USSR losses within postwar borders now stand at 26.6 million,[3][4] including 8 to 9 million due to famine and disease.[4][5][2] In August 2009 the Polish Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) researchers estimated Poland's dead at between 5.6 and 5.8 million.[6] Historian Rüdiger Overmans of the Military History Research Office (Germany) published a study in 2000 that estimated the German military dead and missing at 5.3 million, including 900,000 men conscripted from outside of Germany's 1937 borders, in Austria, and in east-central Europe.[7][8] The Red Army claimed responsibility for the majority of Wehrmacht casualties during World War II.[9] The People's Republic of China puts its war dead at 20 million,[10] while the Japanese government puts its casualties due to the war at 3.1 million.[11]</p></div>
